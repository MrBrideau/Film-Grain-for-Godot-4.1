Simulate film grains! Perfect for a more cinematic experience.

Originally made by [Martinsh](http://devlog-martinsh.blogspot.cz/2013/05/image-imperfections-and-film-grain-post.html) and then ported by [kondelik](https://github.com/kondelik) over to a version of Godot prior to 4.1, I decided to port this one over to Godot 4.1, enjoy!

# Important instructions
You can use the shader in two ways:

1 - To affect the node it is applied to, like a Sprite or ViewportContainer.

2 - As an overlay filter to affect the nodes below it in the Scene hierarchy. Add the shader to a ColorRect or TextureRect.
